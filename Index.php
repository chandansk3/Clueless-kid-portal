   <h3>Missing Child Info Portal</h3>
  <p>

Since its inception in 2000, National Centre For Missing Children is making a impact in protecting karnataka's children, it offers hope to families who know that the search will not end till their child is found. We need your help to get these missing children home soon and safely. It is impossible for any one person, organization or government to search for the missing children on their own. All of us have to join together and help in the search for missing children. Please visit the page "You Can Help" for more details.
